Over a 10 year period, research teams sampled over 800 people and livestock, sampled over 300 rodents, and conducted ecological site characterizations at 150 sites in each Tanzania and South Africa.\nTo integrate data from disparate datasets we developed a novel R pipeline to standardize data cleaning, quality control and integration following reproducible science principals. This was one of the first projects of this scale that I have seen using so many tools that align to current industry best practice:\n\nVersion controlled code in Github with strict code review\nFull CI/CD automation with Github Actions\n\n{targets} as a pipeline tool\n\nR package to store and document all functions\n\n{renv} for package dependency management\n\nProper encrypted environment files for all credentials\n\nA common deterrent I hear from beginners around using tools to aid reproducibility in R code often center around the barriers to entry. They are seen as adding complexity and overhead into the process. Which they do (on small projects), but as projects become more and more complex, the benefits quickly outweigh the costs.\nAn overview of this project was given as a poster at the recent 8th World One Health Congress in Cape Town\n\n\nWant to read more?
