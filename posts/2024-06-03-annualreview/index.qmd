With the financial year drawing to a close in a few weeks, I took the opportunity
to look back on our first full year operating Wave Data Labs.  

In a year full of hype around AI, I was happy to stick with our market position of
'All science, no hype' and now feel even more confident that understanding a problem
deeply and applying traditional mathematical techniques still adds considerable
value. 

The idea to move into more freelance style consulting came from the need to be
more flexible, gain a better work-life balance and deal with some important family 
matters. So while work was not always my focus, I was very committed to delivering a 
premium service and helping my clients solve complex problems.  

Overall, professionally it was an extremely rewarding year filled with diverse projects and interesting
people. Thank you to all of my clients and partners throughout the year, I really appreciated
your support and I hope my work has helped you on your journey.
